> [!CAUTION]
> This addon is currently under development and is not stable. It is strongly discouraged to use it in a production environment. It uses PHP's internal development web server, which is not intended for production use and does not offer the same performance and security as dedicated web server solutions.
>
> It also is built on an experimental build of CraftsNet which are not intended for use in production. Use this addon at own risk as it may break in the future.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have the motivation to optimize this web server for use in production, please create a ticket on our [Discord server](https://dc.craftsblock.de).
